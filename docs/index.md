# 👋 Welcome to my Portfolio

Hi! I'm Kamil Semczuk, a Computer Science student passionate about building projects that combine data engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven applications.  
In this portfolio, you’ll find selected projects that demonstrate both my technical skills and problem-solving approach, from raw data to deployed interactive solutions.

I’m looking for opportunities to grow as a Trainee/Junior Data Engineer and contribute to real-world projects where data infrastructure and analytics play a key role.
