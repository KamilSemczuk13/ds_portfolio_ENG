👋 Welcome to my portfolio
Hi! I'm Kamil Semczuk, a Computer Science student passionate about building projects that combine data engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven applications.

In this portfolio, you’ll find selected projects that demonstrate both my technical skills and my problem-solving approach, from raw data to deployed interactive solutions.

🔧 Technologies I work with:

🐍 Python (pandas, PyCaret, Streamlit, scikit-learn)

🧠 AI & LLMs (OpenAI, Langfuse, Instructor)

🗄️ SQL
Intermediate level – strong knowledge of queries, CTE, subqueries, window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY), transactions, CASE WHEN, and table creation.

⚡ Data Engineering
ETL pipelines in Python (pandas), file processing (CSV, Excel, JSON), deployment on DigitalOcean. Expanding into PySpark, Apache Kafka, and Kubernetes.

🌐 Web & Apps (Streamlit, deployment on DigitalOcean; using storage and buckets for loading/dumping data and ML models)

☁️ Cloud (boto3, S3)

📊 Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
