👋 Welcome to my portfolio
Hi! I'm Kamil Semczuk, a Computer Science student passionate about building projects that combine data engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and AI-driven applications.

In this portfolio, you’ll find selected projects that demonstrate both my technical skills and my problem-solving approach, from raw data to deployed interactive solutions.

🔧 Technologies I Work With
🐍 Python – pandas for data manipulation, PyCaret and scikit-learn for machine learning, Streamlit for building interactive data apps

🧠 AI & LLMs – experience with OpenAI APIs, Langfuse for observability, and Instructor for structured outputs from language models

🗄️ SQL (Intermediate) – strong command of queries, CTEs, subqueries, window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY), transactions, CASE WHEN logic, and table design

⚡ Data Engineering – building ETL pipelines in Python (pandas), handling file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON), deploying projects on DigitalOcean; currently expanding into PySpark, Apache Kafka, and Kubernetes

🌐 Web & Applications – developing Streamlit apps, deploying to DigitalOcean,working with cloud storage and buckets for loading/dumping data and ML models

☁️ Cloud Tools – using boto3 to interact with AWS S3 for data storage and retrieval,
creating Azure SQL Databases, configuring servers, and managing data via Azure 


📊 Data Visualization – creating insightful visuals with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
