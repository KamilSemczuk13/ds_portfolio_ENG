# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi! I'm **Kamil Semczuk**, a Computer Science student passionate about **Data Engineering**.  
I love building robust, efficient, and scalable **data pipelines** and working with large datasets to deliver actionable insights.

This portfolio showcases selected projects that highlight my **Data Engineering skills**, with some additional **Data Science & AI explorations**.

I am looking for opportunities to grow as a **Trainee/Junior Data Engineer** and contribute to projects where **data infrastructure and analytics** make a real impact.
