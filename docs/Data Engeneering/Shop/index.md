A project focused on building a complete retail data pipeline, transforming raw CSV files into a fully interactive analytical application. The goal was to create a system capable of automated data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation, followed by visualization through a dashboard designed to support business decision-making.

⚙️ Key Data Engineering Components:
- Designing and executing SQL queries to extract structured insights from a relational database (SQLite)
- Building a modular ETL pipeline in Python to clean, transform, and aggregate sales data
- Implementing robust data cleaning functions to handle nulls, empty strings, and inconsistent entries
- Mapping and standardizing categorical values (e.g. product categories, months)
- Structuring data for analytical use (e.g. ranking, grouping, pivoting)
- Integrating the pipeline with a Streamlit-based dashboard for interactive exploration

📊 App Features:
- Filtering data by year, customer, product, and performance type
- KPI visualizations: total revenue, top/worst performers, client-level insights
- Interactive charts showing monthly trends, product rankings, and category performance

🧰 Tech Stack:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL (SQLite queries with window functions and CTEs)
- Streamlit (frontend and app logic)
- GitHub Pages (project documentation)


This project demonstrates the practical application of Data Engineering in a business analytics context — turning raw data into a structured, insightful product.
