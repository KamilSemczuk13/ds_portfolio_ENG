The dataset includes information such as gender, age, travel class, family relationships on board, and port of embarkation. The analysis involved initial data cleaning, visualizations, and comparisons between passenger groups. This project demonstrates how historical data can be used to draw practical insights and build analytical intuition.</p> <p>Download notebook with Tytanic analysis</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Aplikacje/Loty/","title":"\u2708\ufe0f Flight 4 U \u2013 Intelligent Flight Search App","text":"\ud83c\udf0d \u2708\ufe0f \ud83d\udcf1 Flight 4 U \u2013 Open App         \ud83d\udc19 Check code on GitHub"},{"location":"Aplikacje/Maraton/","title":"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Half-Marathon Finish Time Predictor","text":"\ud83d\udcd8 Download notebook (model + cloud)         \ud83d\udc19 Check code on GitHub"}]}
