This project focuses on understanding the relationships between different features of the flowers. It includes visualizations, insights, and observations that highlight how much valuable information can be extracted from this classic dataset.</p> <p>Download notebook with Iris Analysis</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Analizy/Titanic/","title":"Data Analysis \u2013 Titanic (EDA)","text":"<p>An exploratory data analysis of Titanic passengers, aimed at identifying the factors that influenced survival during the disaster. The dataset includes information such as gender, age, travel class, family relationships on board, and port of embarkation. The analysis involved initial data cleaning, visualizations, and comparisons between passenger groups. This project demonstrates how historical data can be used to draw practical insights and build analytical intuition.</p> <p>Download notebook with Tytanic analysis</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Aplikacje/Loty/","title":"\u2708\ufe0f Flight 4 U \u2013 Intelligent Flight Search App","text":"\ud83c\udf0d \u2708\ufe0f \ud83d\udcf1 Flight 4 U \u2013 Open App         \ud83d\udc19 Check code on GitHub"},{"location":"Aplikacje/Maraton/","title":"\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Half-Marathon Finish Time Predictor","text":"\ud83d\udcd8 Download notebook (model + cloud)         \ud83d\udc19 Check code on GitHub"}]}
